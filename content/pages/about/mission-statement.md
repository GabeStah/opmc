## Juan de Fuca Chapter Mission Statement

Our mission is to provide an opportunity for men to learn, enjoy, and promote singing barbershop harmony. It is our intent to preserve and encourage quartet formation,development and singing within the chapter and to provide community service through performances of quartets, small groups, and the chorus.

An atmosphere of fellowship and fun will be integrated within the activities of the chapter through scheduled breaks, gang singing, sing-outs, and chapter social functions.

Additionally, members will be sensitive to family obligations, support other members in hardship, and in other endeavors through phone calls, visits, and help.
