### Do you like to sing?

Maybe it’s in your car, or you like the sound in the shower, or just around the house. Then you are the guy we are looking for.

The Olympic Peninsula Men’s Chorus welcomes singers of all musical levels. Most of the guys can’t read music and had never sung in front of an audience before joining. There are no auditions and you won’t be judged on your abilities. Men of all ages are welcome; you can even come with your son or grandson.

We learn the songs with the help of learning tracks and by practicing in rehearsals. In rehearsals you will be partnered with someone who has some experience so you can learn from and with them. With the use of learning tracks you can practice whenever and wherever you want, even in the privacy of your car or home.

You will enjoy camaraderie with the other guys and a team experience in learning and performing the music. ...And it is fun!

For more information, call us at (360) 565-6845 or (360) 681-7761, or just drop in on one of our [rehearsals](/about/rehearsal).

Come sing with us!

Rehearsals are are 6:30 Tuesday evenings at Sunland Golf and Country Club 109 Hilltop in Sequim.
